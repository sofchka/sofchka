### Bonjour! I'm Sofi ðŸ‘‹  
ðŸ’» **Aspiring Developer | Caffeine-Fueled Code Sorcerer** 
I'm a Computer Science major with a particular interest in DevOps. Currently, I'm seeking an internship where I can apply my skills, contribute to impactful projects, and continue growingâ€”hopefully without taking down any servers! 

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™ve brewed up some knowledge in:  
- **Data Structures & Algorithms** â€“ Deep dive into C, working with linked lists, trees, and memory management  
- **System & Server Management** â€“ Hands-on experience with Git, Nginx, Gunicorn, and AWS  

ðŸš€ Right now, Iâ€™m exploring:  
- **Docker & Containerization**  
- **CI/CD Pipelines**  
- **Cloud Services & Deployment**
